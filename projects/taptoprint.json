    "description":"TapToPrint is an Android application for use on a printer. It lets the user print to a virtual printer on Google Cloud Print, and then select the physical printer by tapping a NFC tag onto the printer. Think of a printer vending machine that can identify you, fetch the print job and charge for your printing in a single tap. <br /><br /> Oh, and did I tell you it won the Google GSA development competition?"
